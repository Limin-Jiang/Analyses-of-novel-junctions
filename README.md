Synthetic genome rearrangement reveals dynamics of chromosome evolution shaped by hierarchical chromatin organization


Structural variations on the synthetic chromosomes were identified by the alignment of loxPsym sites and neighboring sequences to the yZSJ025 reference genome sequence. 
Reads containing loxPsym sites and their extensions by 116 bp on both sides were extracted. The following criteria were used to identify and screen rearrangements for further studies: 

(1) Reads containing the entire 34 bp loxPsym site sequences with flanking sequences belonging to two loxPsym sites of the reference; 

(2) Reads with one end less than 4 bp apart from loxPsym were excluded; 

(3) Reads containing two or more mismatched bases were excluded. 

Identical reads were considered as a result of a single rearrangement event. Only two or more reads endorsing a rearrangement event were included in the further analyses.
